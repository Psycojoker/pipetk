text = """This script do nothing except printing the list of available scripts.

Pipetk is a collection of scripts to work on continuous stream of informations
like tail -f output using shell pipes.

All scripts name start with 'p' (for pipe).

Available scripts:
 * pipetk: list this text.

 * puniq: eliminate duplications in real time via a unix pipe.(| sort | uniq
   waits for the full stream to be completed and also sort it, therefor it, for
   example, won't works between a rsstail|feedstail and an ii file).
   Example: feedstail -u http://reddit.com/.rss | puniq

 * pmerge: open a named pipe and write to stdout everything written in the named
   pipe. The first argument given is the name of the named pipe. It doesn't
   managed in any way the possible conflicts between multiple process that write
   on that pipe at the same time.
   Silly example: pmerge PIPE > irc.freenode.net/#laquadrature & echo "pouet" > PIPE

 * purls: really simple url extracting tools. It split each line it receives by
   white space then display on a new line each words that starts with either
   "http" or "https".
   Example: echo "there is 2 urls in this sentence: this one http://blog.worlddomination.be and this one http://laquadrature.net" | purls
   result:
   http://blog.worlddomination.be
   http://laquadrature.net

 * pdetinyfy: get the real url of a shortened url.
   Example: echo "foo http://ur1.ca/4110r bar" | pdetinyfy
   Result: foo http://laquadrature.net bar

 * purltitle: get an url in input and output the url followed by it's title.
   Example: echo "foo http://laquadrature.net bar" | purltitle
   Result: foo http://laquadrature.net La Quadrature du Net | Internet et Libertés bar

 * plag: slow down the displaying of a stream by sleeping a give time beetwen each line
   Can have the number of seconds the sleep as arg (accept float value).
   Example: dmseg | plag
   or: dmesg | plag 60

 * puniqrt: try to avoid duplications of similar tweets. For example by removing
   RT tweets of a tweet that has already been displayed.
   Behave in the same way that puniq.

 * premoveurls: remove the urls from a string. This is more an example script
   for the URLPipeTemplate class than something really usefull.
   Example: echo "foo http://laquadrature.net bar" | premoveurls
   Result: foo bar

 * cleanurls: clean urls by removing useless informations like tracking stuff
   like "?utm_*" args added to urls.
